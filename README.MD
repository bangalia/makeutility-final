[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/bangalia/makeutlity-final)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/bangalia/makeutility-final)

This is my Golang final project. This project uses a goroutine to download the contents of a wbesite and save them to a file with the website's name. Since the ACS department is now offically apart of Dominican University, the websites I use in this implementation are sites I feel would be useful to anyone starting out in the computer science program.

*Note: My github was acting up and kept copying additionl folders to the repository. So these finals will be manually added to another repository for the sake of code neatness and downloadability. Original repo is still public [Old Repository](https://github.com/bangalia/makeutility)
